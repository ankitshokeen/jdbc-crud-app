## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Create a Sample SQL Table

- **Delete:** Remove a registration.

### 3. Use a SQL Database
The project uses a MySQL database. Make sure to handle database connections and operations properly.

### 4. Submission Guidelines
- Separate the backend and frontend code into different directories.
- Create a README file for both the backend and frontend, detailing steps to run the project.
- Push the code to a GitHub repository and share the link via email.
